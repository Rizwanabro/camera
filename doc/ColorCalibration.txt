Trace the hand as a polygon in a particular position
* Sample parameters (saturation, exposure, gain, brightness, blue, red) until the maximum number of pixels in the hand region are classified.
* Take the pixels, cluster into 10 colors with k-means with multiple restarts OR
Trace each of the color regions as polygons in a particular position

Find a single linear transformation so that all of the colors are classified appropriately
